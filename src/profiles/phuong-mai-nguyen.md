    I always love helping people to feel motivated to enter the tech industry. I
    have been mentoring for the last two years people in different backgrounds
    like customer support and fashion design University student. They want to
    learn more about coding but did not know where to start so I hope through
    mentoring with them regularly, I could support them in opening more
    opportunities in their career.

“The power you have is to be the best version of yourself you can be, so you can create a better world”

A favorite quote that makes up my purpose and career, and to be the best I can, I always do what I love - coding and sharing knowledge. I am a coder who likes to help people work more efficiently using IT. Currently a Software Developer at Carsales and Adult Education Lead at Code Like a Girl, I spend most of my time devising efficient solutions for customers, taking advantage of all the bleeding edge technologies. And when I am not coding away solutions, you can find me conducting workshops across schools and organizations, promoting women in tech via Code Like a Girl and Carsales Go4Tech initiatives.
