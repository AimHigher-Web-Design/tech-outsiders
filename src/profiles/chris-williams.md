I'm an IT Project Manager with over a decade of experience. I have worked for some very large organisations, such as SAP and FMG, and have made a bit of a sea change to work for a not-for-profit, where I get to do a bit of everything. 

I have Masters in Computer Science, and don't mind "getting my hands dirty". I am passionate about change management, and implementing systems the right way. 

In my spare time I like to make jewellery, and have set up my own small business selling at craft markets.
