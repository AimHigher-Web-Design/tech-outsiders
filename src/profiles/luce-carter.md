I am a software developer in the UK with a love for all things mobile! I work as an ASP.Net Backend developer by day but in my free time I moonlight as a Xamarin developer, public speaker, copy-editor, blogger, newsletter curator, Twitch streamer, Youtuber content creator, Twilio Champion and Microsoft MVP.

I love sharing knowledge, learning new things and meeting new people at user groups and conferences. Away from tech I also enjoy walks, exercise and cooking.
