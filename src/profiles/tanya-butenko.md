I am passionate about free education and diversity and doing all I can to support and promote women in IT. Teacher, translator, manager previously, nowadays software engineer and IT community activist. 

After finishing General Assembly in December 2014 on web-development immersive 3-month course I stepped into IT world and started my journey as a web developer. Today I'm working in Hireup as a software engineer, co-organizer of Women Who Code Sydney chapter, Muses Code JS (previously known as NodeGirls) Founder, CEO.
