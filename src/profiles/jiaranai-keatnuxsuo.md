I am a recent IT graduate from the University of Western Australia and a Technical Account Manager at Microsoft. I believe in technology because of its powerful abilities to augment ordinary people to become extraordinary. My background is all about people, not just machines; I was involved in a personal development project using technology to help 400 students in my community to unlock their potential. My obsession of “technology + people = superhuman” led me to give a TEDx Talk about how to prepare human to progress alongside technology in this ever-changing era.
