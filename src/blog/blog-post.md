    Recap of all the shows I saw in 2017 when I decided to go for it and buy a
    heap of tickets to shows rather than saying I was going to and not getting
    around to it.

We all do it, see an event coming up, use the phrase "\_I’m going to go to that, I’ll see who wants to come with me" \_and inevitably find that we don’t go at all. This year I decided that was going to change, so sat down and purchased 2 tickets to a bunch of shows I’d like to see. With a fairly wide range including comedy, Shakespeare, classical and contemporary music and of course the ballet, I’ve already had the chance to see a few different and entertaining things and haven’t had any issues finding a date.
